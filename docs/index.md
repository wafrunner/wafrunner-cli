# Welcome to wafrunner-cli

This is the main documentation site for the `wafrunner-cli` project.

This documentation contains non-code assets that are useful for project development, such as design files and reference materials. The contents are shared across the team but are not part of the application's build or distribution.

To add more pages, create new `.md` files in this `docs/` directory and add them to the `nav` section of the `mkdocs.yml` file.
